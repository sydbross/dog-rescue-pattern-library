The buttons use our primary colour to draw attention and stand out. Each button has a specific purpose:

- The regular buttons are for the main homepage (cards). They stand out bright against the pale background.
- The light buttons are for over the banner.
- The ghost button is for content heavy pages (aka adoption page) so that it does not appear cluttered.
